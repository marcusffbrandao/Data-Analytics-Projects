# Ironhack - Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Project 1 - Games in Python

 Implement a game in Python using basic data structures.

#### Main Objectives

Build your own game from scratch, using Jupyter Notebook. Put into practice the basic Python which
you’ve learned this week. Don’t forget to create well documented version of
your code using the concepts of docstrings we’ve learned.

#### Deliverables

- A clean version of your Jupiter Notebook
- Upload it to your GitHub account

#### Requirements

Student have to use:
- Python Data Structures learned (lists, dicts etc.);
- Functions;
- EXTRA: You can use classes to enhance your code

## Hangman Game (Jogo da Forca)

This game can be buit in a few lines of code, in a simpler way. However, in order to meet the requirements and demonstrate that I have learned the basic concepts of Python programming, I used:
- local and class variables;
- lists;
- functions (including input) ;
- if, elif and else statements;
- other opertators (arithmetic, assignment, relational, boolean etc.);
- loops (while and for);
- formatted string literals;
- error handling;
- Regular Expression (REGEX); and
- EXTRA: classes and objects;

## Installation

To trial this project, clone the repository and open it using Jupyter Notebook.

Run all the code and have fun!

If you want to play again, just run the cell with the function "play-game()" again.
